## Read: 05 - HTML Images; CSS Color & Text

### HTML Images:
 - this is the tag for adding images to pages:
 ```
 <img src="images/quokka.jpg" alt="A family of
 quokka" title="The quokka is an Australian
 marsupial that is similar in size to the
 domestic cat." />
 ```
- Figure and Figure Caption : use it to add photo and caption for it:




```
<figure>
<img src="images/otters.jpg" alt="Photograph of
 two sea otters floating in water">
<br />
 <figcaption>Sea otters hold hands when they
 sleep so they don't drift away from each
 other.</figcaption>
</figure>
```
- Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or
logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.


### Colors in CSS:

- **change color by name** ``` h1 {color: DarkCyan;}```
- **change hex by code** ```h2 {color: #ee3e80;}```
- **change rgb by value** ```p {color: rgb(100,100,90);}```


### Notes on Color in CSS:
1. Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.
2. There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
3. Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
4. It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).
5. CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
6. CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.
